Checklist
- Finish my sentiment analysis (also if possible speed up the analysis)

- Find a way to gather more bigrams
- Weigh bigrams more for reviews
- Ask professor questions (bigram help, other ways to increase accuracy)
- Thinking ahead: Predict star rating (excluding 3 range)
- Thinking ahead: Bar graphs (or something similar) to compare previous accuracies to the accuracy turned in at final
